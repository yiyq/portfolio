                        As one part of  brand development, I created a marketing website for increasing the popularity and
                        expanding the team. A sitemap helped me organize the information and visualized the structure.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        I joined Medforall as my first full-time job after graduation. I am very glad having this opportunity
                        to develop the company’s brand identity. This is a valuable process from knowing this industry, contact
                        with people working in this field and apply multiple skill sets to accomplish the projects. These are huge
                        steps for this start-up and as well as myself, and this is just the begining.
                        <br /><br />
                        If you would like to see more works I have done with this company, please feel free to contact me.

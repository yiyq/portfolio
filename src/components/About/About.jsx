                            Hi, I am <mark className="pink">Yunqing Yi</mark>.<br />
                            Very nice to meet you!
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            I am a UI/UX designer, currently working for a healthcare company in Columbus, OH. I was born
                            and raised in Shanghai, China. I came to U.S. for my undergraduate and graduate education
                            in Design and have been here for 8 years.<br /><br />
                            I like traveling and learning different culture and habitude. I have been to over 15 countries
                            and enjoyed those unfamiliar but attractive atmospheres they brought to me.<br /><br />
                            Although in this hard year 2020, I didnâ€™t stop exploring my life. I have a new teammate join me
                            with the advanture, Dodo, a four months old corgi puppy. We are ready to welcome any
                            opportunities which can let us explore more to this world and in ourselfves.<br /><br />
